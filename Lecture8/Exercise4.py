You have a bucket with 3 red balls and 3 green balls.
 Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket,
 you don't replace it. What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color?

Write a Monte Carlo simulation to solve the above problem.
 Feel free to write a helper function if you wish.
  DO NOT import random, it will be imported for you.
